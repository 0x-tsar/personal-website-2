          At 27, I am seeking opportunities as a Solidity developer with a very
          good understanding of Solidity and Foundry for testing, also
          specialized expertise in Blockchain aspects, particularly Ethereum. I
          understand EVM/Bytecode and have some knowledge in JavaScript, Java
          for Android, and Python for Deep Learning. I have set aside the latter
          languages to focus solely on Solidity and other useful languages for
          Ethereum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2017, I have been actively engaged in learning about Blockchain
          and Solidity. I began my professional career as a developer in 2021,
          conducting Quality Assurance (QA) reviews and identifying bugs in
          Smart Contracts through Bug Bounties sites such as Code4rena and
          Codehawks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am developing a protocol dedicated to Decentralized
          Finance (DeFi) and Governance. I have completed the Minimum Viable
          Product (MVP) and the first iteration, and am now conducting tests
          using Foundry.
